User Package Customizations

The files here are files that I keep in my User package that I use to customize Sublime Text 3 to my whims and desires. There's nothing ground breaking or earth shattering here.

However, since I use git to keep my User package backed up and synced across all of my machines, and this repository started as a clone of that one, here we are.

Note that I use Sublime Text over all three platforms and everything here will work across all platforms. However, for the sake of brevity I included my custom key bindings as a single file which has entirely the wrong name.

Should you actually be interested in the bindings themselves, I recommend copying them to your own bindings file.
Usage

With the exception of the sublime-keymap file, any of these files can be put directly into your User package (or any other package) and they will take effect. If you already have such a file, you should open both and copy the entries from my files into yours so you don't lose your own customizations.

For the sublime-keymap file, you should copy the key bindings into your own custom bindings, which are stored in a similar file but which contains the name of your platform in it (e.g. Default (Windows).sublime-keymap) so that Sublime knows what platform it is for.
